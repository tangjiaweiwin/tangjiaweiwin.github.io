Among the youths, Wei Wu Xian, the son of a deceased member of the Jiang Clan, is a cheerful man, and he meets and becomes close friends with Lan Zhiji, a disciple of the Gusu Blue Clan, who is known for his elegance. The two discovered the secret that the Blue Clan had been guarding, and they inherited the will to eliminate the hidden danger for the people. But they never thought that the master behind everything was Wen Ruohan, the head of the Wen family. The families were so humiliated that they joined forces to crush the Wen family.

            <p>Li Shiyi dreamed that the 45 bus she was on exploded as she was walking towards the cross-river bridge, and she was awakened by the explosion. After waking up, she finds that the experience on the bus is exactly the same as her dream. After repeatedly trying to stop the explosion without success, she is convinced that she has entered a time loop. Meanwhile, Xiao He-yun, who was forcibly dragged off the bus during the sixth time loop, also entered the loop together with Li Shi-er. The two ordinary young people experienced life and death challenges, grew up and learned the stories behind the passengers on the 45 bus with different identities in the cycle. In the end, with the joint efforts of the two and the police, they finally find the truth about the explosion. Justice will come in the end, as the two names foretell, ushering in the "clear sky a crane row on the clouds, then lead poetry to the sky" of the clear and open.</p >
